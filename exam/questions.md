# 1.2 Preliminary task
- I would think that it would then be somewhere around 4^300 = 4.15e180. It would not be as large since some of these would probably "crash" with each other
- It would take around 4.15e168 seconds. Quite a long time
- Assuming an unsigned int with 128 bits, largest integer is 2^128 - 1. Not enough!! Largest Float
