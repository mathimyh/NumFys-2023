function unfolded_chain2D(len::Int)
    
    #=

    Initalizes a straight chain of monomers on a 2D grid. Returns the vector of these. 
    Further in the code, when we check if a monomer has neighbours, it takes a long time to use 
    the position to check if the position is in the vector, and return the index. So we use a
    dictionary to keep track of which acids are in which positions. Since the number of acids
    doesnt get too high this will not pose a problem.
